    <h2> The University of Maryland's salary data is public information, but it's a huge dataset, often convoluted and difficult to sift through. I've organized the salary data to be more accesible. Below, you'll find summary graphics as well as the full dataset </h2>

    <h2>Non-Tenured, Non-Regular Faculty 
        Faculty positions are academic positions, that involve teaching, research, scholarship, artistic creativity or academic administration. “Faculty Non-Regular, Non-tenured” is an employment category assigned to Faculty who have a paid appointment of less than 6 months, or are non-paid. As such, they are non-regular employees who are not eligible for any benefits, retirement, or paid leave. Faculty Non-Regular, Non-tenured appointees are paid on a salary with an FTE appropriate to their level of work. Paid faculty working under this category will receive wages for Paid Holidays or Administrative Leave incurred during their contract term. Generally appointees to this category will be term-only Lecturers, Faculty Research Assistants, and some visiting faculty.</h2>


       <h2>Non-Tenured, Term. Contr. Faculty
        Faculty positions are academic positions that involve teaching, research, scholarship, artistic creativity or academic administration. “Faculty Non-tenured, Term Contract” is a “regular” employment category assigned to faculty who have a renewable appointment, which does not carry tenure. Appointees to this category will be eligible for full benefits and must be salaried. The appointee must be paid on an account with a subcode in the 1000 series; such account can be state, self-support, or contract & grant. His/her appointment must be renewed at each expiration.</h2> 


        <h2>Non-Tenured,Cont. Contr. Faculty
            Faculty positions are academic positions that involve teaching, research, scholarship, artistic creativity, or academic administration. “Faculty Non-tenured, Continuing” is an employment category assigned to faculty who have been appointed to a continuing appointment which does not carry tenure. Appointees to this category may be eligible for benefits as defined in the contract, and must be salaried. The appointee must be on a line item in the state budget and his/her appointment does not need to be renewed each year, but may be if so stipulated in the employment agreement. This category is typically used for faculty research assistants, grand-parented instructors with job security, officers and deans without faculty rank, professional librarians, and university coaches. Continuing appointments supported on research or self-support funds must be renewed each year. If it is intended to hire a faculty member on the tenure track but s/he does not have degree transcript documentation, s/he may be hired into this Non-tenured, Continuing and Term Contract category until the degree documentation is received. If tenure is not granted to a tenure-track faculty member, s/he is given a one-year terminal non-tenured faculty position in this category.</h2>


        <h2>Tenure Track Faculty 
            Faculty positions are academic positions that involve teaching, research, scholarship, artistic creativity or academic administration. “Faculty Non-tenured on Track” is an employment category assigned to faculty who are hired on the tenure-track and are eligible for a tenure review as defined in the institution’s policy on the Appointment, Promotion and Tenure of Faculty. New tenure-track faculty can be hired at the rank of assistant professor or associate professor. For detailed information about the policies and procedures for appointing tenure-track faculty, please visit the Office of Faculty Affairs website.</h2>


        <h2>Tenured Faculty
            Faculty positions are academic positions that involve teaching, research, scholarship, artistic creativity or academic administration. “Faculty Tenured” is an employment category assigned to faculty who have been granted tenure with their initial appointment or through a tenure review process after serving up to six years in a tenure-track appointment. Initial appointments to the position of full professor carry automatic tenure. Tenure-bearing ranks are Associate Professor, Professor, and Distinguished University Professor. Tenure guarantees a faculty member continued employment until s/he resigns or retires, is terminated for just cause, is dismissed due to programmatic discontinuation, is deemed to have abandoned her/his position, or dies. Initial appointments to the title of Associate Professor can be tenured or tenure-track. There are some Assistant Professors who have been grandfathered with tenure.</h2>
